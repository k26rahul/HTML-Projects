    <h1>The Sunflower Friend</h1>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, there was a little girl named
      <span class="highlight">Lily</span>. She had a unique friend, a
      <span class="highlight">sunflower</span>. Every day, Lily would talk to
      the
      <span class="highlight">sunflower</span>
      and share her dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, the
      <span class="highlight">sunflower</span>
      seemed to be drooping. Lily was worried. She gently watered it and said,
      "You are my <span class="highlight">best friend</span>, and I will always
      take care of you."
    </p>
    <h2>A Special Bond</h2>
    <p>
      Lily and the
      <span class="highlight golden-highlight">sunflower</span>
      grew together. The sunflower always stood tall, and Lily felt the magic of
      <span class="highlight golden-highlight">care</span> and
      <span class="highlight golden-highlight">friendship</span>.
    </p>
